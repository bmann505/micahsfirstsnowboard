      <h2> First of Many</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> It was a clear blue sky, the sun was shining and the snow was fresh. Some might call it a bluebird day. The place? Lakewood Colorado. January 2017 Micah experienced his first snowboarding excursion. Granted it was at the local park, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
      <p>&nbsp</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">He loves the snow and anything athletic. It is even better if there is some danger involved so Snowboarding and Micah are a match made in heaven. He is a first generation Coloradian but will learn the love of snow and mountains from his New Mexican parents. </p>
